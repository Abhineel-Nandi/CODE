# CODE
A minimalistic bare bone emulation of VIM/NVIM Text Editors

This project has been made comprehensively to be understandable by layman
too. This had been on my list for many days and I had it on my private repo for 
too long.

**CODE** as a text editor that is extremely light and minimal when
compared to ***VIM/NVIM*** . Its compatible with all terminal and shell prompts 
including WSL in windows. It has nearly 1200 lines of Code ,and 
has been made in a very modular approach with no additional dependencies and entirely written in c.

Installation : 
    
    git clone https://github.com/Abhineel-Nandi/code.git
    cd code
    make
    sudo cp CODE /usr/local/bin/

Usage: CODE `<filename>`

Keys:

    CTRL-S: Save
    CTRL-Q: Quit
    CTRL-F: Find string in file (ESC to exit search, arrows to navigate)
    
## TODO FEATURES

Would like to bring in more customization and improve scrolling as in nvim 
instead of the traditional scrolling effect.

I would be elated to know more features and would be open to pull requests 
and intrested contributors.

If you like this implementation then star this repo as my appreciation.
